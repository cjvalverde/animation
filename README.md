# animation

**Version 1.0.0**

Code files and classes needed to implement an animated and interactive aquarium
To test it, clone this repository and run main.py on any IDE. I use Pycharm.
As you can notice the file graphics.py is included in the repossitory. Normally, you would have to download it and add it to your project folder (next to main) to get the pgraphics funktionalities.
