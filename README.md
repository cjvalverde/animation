# animation

**Version 1.0.0**

Code files and classes needed to implement an animated and interactive aquarium.

To test it, clone this repository and run main.py on any IDE. I use Pycharm.

This program uses GRAPHICS from John Zelle. Since I started developing this in repl.it, I had to dwonload it from https://pypi.org/project/graphics.py/ and copy the file graphics.py in the project folder, next to main.py.
